          We all want to live better lives,have better things and create a
          better world but the real question is how?
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4" style={{margin:"1rem 7rem"}}>
          In such a fast paced world, we seldom think of our own roots. We have
          lost the very essence of this life and creation because we are always
          chasing something better or bigger. But what about this miraculous
          life force that is throbbing in each cell of yours, giving you all
          that you need for you to exist? What are we doing with this body and
          mind - <strong>the greatest creation of nature.</strong>
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4" style={{margin:"1rem 7rem"}}>
          Isn’t it quite rare that we pay attention to our own thoughts,
          emotions and actions, rather we are caught up in knowing others,
          checking feeds, reading news and everything that happens outside of
          us. But do you know that what happens in your life is solely
          controlled by what happens inside of you. The thoughts that we think
          and the emotions that we feel drive our actions.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4" style={{margin:"1rem 7rem"}}>
          In today’s world, 70% of the people are stressed, anxious or depressed
          and the only reason is, they don’t pay attention to themselves. Take a
          moment and recall the most happiest moment in your life and you will
          know that you can change the way you feel just by shifting your focus
          to a happy memory. So if thinking about a happy memory could make you
          feel emotionally good then it is very much possible that thinking sad
          thoughts would make you emotionally dull.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4" style={{margin:"1rem 7rem"}}>
          As it has been said, <strong>“Practice makes a man perfect”</strong>, Rehearsing to
          think happy thoughts would make you perfect at feeling happy and
          energetic emotions. And choosing your thoughts and emotions makes you
          independent of everything and everyone. Once you have such a level of
          control over your mind and body, the magic will flow into your life.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4" style={{margin:"1rem 7rem"}}>
          The only way to have control over your thoughts and emotions is to
          change your subconscious program. The subconscious program is nothing
          but the part of the brain that controls 95% of our actions like the
          very routine you follow has become so effortless now that you do the
          same thing at the same time everyday, even without thinking about it.
          Everything that you have practiced over a period of time, be it
          thoughts, emotions, actions or reactions have now become habits. And
          these habits form the program and then it goes on autopilot where you
          keep thinking and feeling the same way all the time.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4" style={{margin:"1rem 7rem"}}>
          The door to your subconscious mind opens right after you wake up and
          right before you go to bed because we have low frequency brain waves
          at those times of the day. This is the perfect time to change your
          subconscious program to build the habit of thinking, feeling and
          acting as you want yourself to. The formula is -<strong>MEDITATION</strong>.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4" style={{margin:"1rem 7rem"}}>
          Meditation has been the core practice in ancient India and it has
          proved to improve the overall lives of people and, currently Science
          researched and used it to heal a lot of unfortunate people just by the
          practice of meditation.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4" style={{margin:"1rem 7rem"}}>
          It is a technique to empty your mind and then rehearse in your mind
          the exact thoughts, emotions and actions. When you keep doing this
          consistently for a period of time, just like laziness was so
          effortless, being happy and healthy would become effortless.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4" style={{margin:"1rem 7rem"}}>
          It not only helps you to rebuild yourself but it connects you to the
          very source of our creation and the nature of love. It is the only way
          of life, rest is just survival.
        </p>
